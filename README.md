# **Group Project 1: Fitness and Food** #

# *Description* #

The Precious Narwhals team have developed and accomplished our goal of delivering a MVP for our project. The application allows users to sign up
and browse various workout exercises and meal recipes to help accomplish their goal of a healthier lifestyle.

# *The team* #

* Kobe Robinson
* Alex Groat
* Jacob Constantinidis
* Mansi Patel

# *User Story* #

As a person who wants to improve my health, I want an easy way to find workouts and recipes, so I can further improve my well being.

# *The Process* #

# Technologies Used #

HTML, CSS, Javascript,Foundation, the Spoonacular API and the Wger API.

# Breakdown of Tasks #

The team worked collaboratively to expand our concept. Kobe lead development with the HTML skeleton, CSS formatting and bug fixing. Alex primarily worked with the HTML skeleton,
webpage layout, Javascript and the API functionality. 

# Challenges #

Challenges we encountered: Changing idea through project, switching out APIs to find an easy to use API, git branch conflicts. 

# Successes #

Developing a deeper understanding of how to use APIs and reading the documentation to its full extent. Another success was resolving git branch conflicts, how to review others code and working as a team. 

# *Directions for Future Development* #

Fitness and Food expects to see new features in the coming future such as a Favourite Button for selected exercise and meals,
able to search for nutrition information, ingredients, equipment needed to cook the meal and a price breakdown of the meal,
user can create their own unique profile,
create a meal plan for the week in which users can enter data to track their fitness journey,
create a blog where users can post favourite recipes and exercises and share their journey with others.
